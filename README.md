OLDSCHOOL - BE AGAINST AI


You are inside of a major AI datacenter playing as a big awesome steampunk spider. Your mission is to destroy as much as possible.

NOTE: this game is super early in development, im not quite sure about the future of it and if i will work on it in the long run, but this game needs a little introduction before you can begin playing.
The premise is simple: destroy servers, kill AI's, go to the next level.
Be sure to stay away from the AI security guard's eyes, or else you might be eliminated.
Make sure to look out for the servers you destroy, as the ones with the glow may alert some nearby guards.

The controls, credits & links can be found in-game. Have fun!
